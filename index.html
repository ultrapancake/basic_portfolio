            <p>My name is Glen Larsen, I am currently the meat department manager at Smith's Food and Drug in the Avenues, Salt Lake City, Utah.  I have been a butcher for 10 years now, 2 of which I have been managing my own shop.  I absolutely love my job; however, I have reached the peak of my long term goals. <br>
                I am looking forward to starting a new career where I am able to set, and achieve, short and long term goals.</p>

            <p>In my personal life I have two beautiful young boys ages 6 and 7.  My wife and I recently purchased a new home and are slowly improving it every year, this year was a new roof.
